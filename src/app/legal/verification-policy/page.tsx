          During registration we collect your professional license number, issuing state or country,
          and expiry date. Before fulfilling a first order — and periodically thereafter — our team may:

        <p>
          Orders from unverified accounts are held in <em>pending review</em> status until verification
          is complete. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order where licensure cannot be
          confirmed, where products are restricted in the destination jurisdiction, or where we believe
          the purchase is not for legitimate professional use.

          You are responsible for keeping your license information accurate and up to date in your
